# Penguin
Penguin is a powerful command-line tool and Rust library that helps you generate strong, memorable passwords and comprehensive password lists by transforming your personal meaningful words into secure credentials. Instead of dealing with completely random strings, Penguin allows you to create passwords that maintain a connection to words that matter to you while ensuring security through various complexity transformations.

## Getting Started
Currently, Penguin is available directly from GitHub. You can use it either as a command-line tool or integrate it into your Rust projects.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/theiskaa/penguin
```
or add this to your `Cargo.toml`, in order to install as library:
```toml
[dependencies]
penguin = { git = "https://github.com/theiskaa/penguin" }
```

Penguin offers two main functionalities: password generation and password list creation.

## Password Generation
At its core, Penguin takes a set of words you provide and transforms them into secure passwords. The basic usage is straightforward - simply run `penguin generate -w word1,word2,word3` with your chosen words. What makes Penguin powerful is its flexibility in password generation through various complexity levels and options.

You can control how your passwords are generated by specifying the complexity level (basic, medium, hard, or penguin), where each level adds more sophisticated character substitutions and variations. For instance, while the basic level might simply combine your words, the penguin level applies extensive character substitutions and additions to create highly secure passwords that still maintain a connection to your original words.
